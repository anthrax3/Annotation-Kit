## Shadow Remover Tool

Shadow Remover is a handy tool to quickly remove shadow from a window screenshot. Itâ€™s a great companion for anyone who is making documentation, writing articles or preparing presentations. By removing a shadow from your screenshot, it becomes more clear and less cluttered.

With this tool you could easily achieve the following result:

### How To Use

1. Make a Window Screenshot using standard `Ctrl+Shift+Cmd+4`, hover over a window and hit `Space`.
2. Paste it into the page.
3. Select resulting image layer.
4. Hit `Ctrl+A` to remove the shadow.

### Caution

Shadow remover works only with window screenshots that have a certain pattern of bitmap data. It tests several pixels for transparency and color components to be sure that the reference bitmap layer is actually a window screenshot.

The following pixel probes are used during screenshot validation:

This means that Shadow Remover works only with window screenshots that have standard shape and shadow. Popover windows, menus and windows with custom shape are not supported.
