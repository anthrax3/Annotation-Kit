Annotation-Kit
==============

Annotation Kit is a collection of useful tools and plugins for [Sketch App](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) that help with adding annotations to your designs. Currently this package contains just a few tools, but pretty soon it will grow to a full fledged solution.

I will be posting updates in my twitter. Follow me [@turbobabr](https://twitter.com/turbobabr) to stay tuned.

## Installation

1. [Download Annotation-Kit.zip archive file](https://github.com/turbobabr/Annotation-Kit/archive/master.zip).
2. Reveal plugins folder in finder ('Sketch App Menu' -> 'Plugins' -> 'Reveal Plugins Folder...').
3. Copy downloaded zip file to the revealed folder and un-zip it.
4. You are ready to go! :)

**Note: All the plugins in this package work only in Sketch 3.2 Beta**

## Change Log

#### v0.1.0: December 2, 2014

- Initial release with only `Shadow Remover` and `Icon Extractor` tools

## Shadow Remover Tool

Shadow Remover is a handy tool to quickly remove shadow from a window screenshot. Itâ€™s a great companion for anyone who is making documentation, writing articles or preparing presentations. By removing a shadow from your screenshot, it becomes more clear and less cluttered.

With this tool you could easily achieve the following result:

### How To Use

1. Make a Window Screenshot using standard `Ctrl+Shift+Cmd+4`, hover over a window and hit `Space`.
2. Paste it into the page.
3. Select resulting image layer.
4. Hit `Ctrl+A` to remove the shadow.

### Caution

Shadow remover works only with window screenshots that have a certain pattern of bitmap data. It tests several pixels for transparency and color components to be sure that the reference bitmap layer is actually a window screenshot.

The following pixel probes are used during screenshot validation:

This means that Shadow Remover works only with window screenshots that have standard shape and shadow. Popover windows, menus and windows with custom shape are not supported.

## Icon Extractor Tool

Icon Extractor Tool allows to extract contents of icons associated with application bundle or any file system object. It also allows to extract all or specific size representations from Apple `.icns` files or Windows `.ico` file.

This tool has nothing to do with annotations, but anyway I decided to include it in the package, since it's a real helper for designing graphics for documentation, articles or presentation. It's also might be used to quickly grab an icon of desired size and use it as a reference during graphics design process.

### How To Use

1. Launch plugin `Annotation-Kit - > Extract Icon`.
2. Choose application, icon file or any other object you want extract icon from.
3. Hit `Grab Icon!` button.
4. You've just got some icons on your page! :)

> IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't forget that all the icons are belong to their respective owners! :)
